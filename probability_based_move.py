#
#  The following two functions are to be developed by you. They are functions in class Robot. If you need,
#  you can add more functions in this file. In this case, you need to link these functions at the beginning
#  of class Robot in the main program file the_wumpus_world.py.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Function 1. PitWumpus_probability_distribution(self, width, height)
#
# For this assignment, we treat a pit and the wumpus equally. Each room has two states: 'empty' or 'containing a pit or the wumpus'.
# A Boolean variable to represent each room: 'True' means the room contains a pit/wumpus, 'False' means the room is empty.
#
# For a cave with n columns and m rows, there are totally n*m rooms, i.e., we have n*m Boolean variables to represent the rooms.
# A configuration of pits/wumpus in the cave is an event of these variables.
#
# The function PitWumpus_probability_distribution() below is to construct the joint probability distribution of all possible
# pits/wumpus configurations in a given cave, two parameters
#
# width : the number of columns in the cave
# height: the number of rows in the cave
#
# In this function, you need to create an object of JointProbDist to store the joint probability distribution and  
# return the object. The object will be used by your function next_room_prob() to calculate the required probabilities.
#
# This function will be called in the constructor of class Robot in the main program the_wumpus_world.py to construct the
# joint probability distribution object. Your function next_room_prob() will need to use the joint probability distribution
# to calculate the required conditional probabilities.
#
def PitWumpus_probability_distribution(self, width, height): 
    self.PW_variables = [] 
    for col in range(1, width + 1):
        for rw in range(1, height + 1):
            self.PW_variables  = self.PW_variables  + ['(%d,%d)'%(col,rw)]
    print(self.PW_variables)
    rooms_aval = []
    rooms_aval = list(self.available_rooms)
    bs = self.observation_breeze_stench(self.visited_rooms)
    pw = self.observation_pits(self.visited_rooms)

    out = JointProbDist(rooms_aval, { each:[T, F] for each in rooms_aval })

    events = all_events_jpd(rooms_aval, out, pw)
    for event in events:
        prob__ = 1
        for (var, val) in event.items():
            if val:
                prob__ *= .2
            else:
                prob__ *= .8
        out[each] = self.consistent(bs, event) * prob__

    return out
        
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Function 2. next_room_prob(self, x, y)
#
#  The parameters, (x, y), are the robot's current position in the cave environment.
#  x: column
#  y: row
#
#  This function returns a room location (column,row) for the robot to go.
#  There are three cases:
#
#    1. Firstly, you can call the function next_room() of the logic-based agent to find a
#       safe room. If there is a safe room, return the location (column,row) of the safe room.
#    2. If there is no safe room, this function needs to choose a room whose probability of containing
#       a pit/wumpus is lower than the pre-specified probability threshold, then return the location of
#       that room.
#    3. If the probabilities of all the surrounding rooms are not lower than the pre-specified probability
#       threshold, return (0,0).
